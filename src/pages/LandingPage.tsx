				I built a Python web application that generates call graph diagrams that show how functions relate to each other and how execution flows across a codebase.
				The idea was to make it easier to understand complex projects by turning raw source code into something visual and interactive.

				HTTP Server Engine Using Linux Epoll

			<p

				One of my all-time favorite projects was building an HTTP server from scratch.
				I wrote it in C++ and used Linux epoll for handling communication between the server and clients.
				I enjoyed this project because it had tremendous added value, it taught me how data actually flows through the internet, how APIs work,
				and how core HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE are implemented.

				<div>
					<p 
						className="text-[15px] leading-tight pr-[1cm] pb-1"
					>
						The server i built is able to serve static content and dynamic content using CGI scripts, and its core features included, using EPOLL
						to efficiently monitor client connections, parsing raw HTTP requests, and constructing proper responses for the client.
					</p>
					<p 
						className="text-[15px] leading-tight pr-[1cm] pb-1"
					>
						One of the more interesting challenges was handling file uploads. To make this reliable,
						I designed a binary-safe string class as a replacement for std::string. This allowed the server to manage large file uploads efficiently
						and stay stable even under heavy load.
					</p>
					<p 
						className="text-[15px] leading-tight pr-[1cm] pb-1"
					>
						To validate the serverâ€™s functionality, I tested it extensively with Postman, ensuring that requests were handled correctly,
						responses matched expectations, and edge cases (including error handling) were covered.
